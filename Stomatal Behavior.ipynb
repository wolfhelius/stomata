Obviously, this simplifies many calculations considerably. Nevertheless, there is a large body of empirical literature on plant vascular systems that shows that hydraulic conductance in the fine roots, woody tissue, and leaves is not fixed, but rather declines with decreasing water potential (Sperry Hacke Oren Comstock 2002; Maherali and Jackson 2004; Guyot Scoffoni Sack 2011).  A variety of different functions have been fit to observations of curves describing the percent loss of conductance (PLC) of xylem tissues, but we have adopted the Weibull function as a general form that describes most empirical data and has useful mathematical properties (continuous derivatives, etc): \n",

    "$E_{demand}$ describes the flux of water from the mesophyll of the plant, into the sub-stomatal cavity, and out the stomatal pore into the bulk atmosphere.  $E_{demand}$ is defined as the product of the bulk leaf conductance, $g$ (units $M_{air}/L_{leaf}^2$) and the gradient in water vapor from inside the leaf ($w_L$, units $M_{H_2O}/V_{air}$) to the air ($w_a$):\n",

    "Leaf conductance is determined in large measure by the conductance of air across the pores of the stomata, $g_s$, which is actively regulated by higher plants in response to prevailing environmental conditions (e.g. light, $CO_2$, ambient humidity, soil moisture) as well as hormonal signals (ABA). Stomatal conductance is a bulk phenomenon that can be thought of as a combination of the number of leaves and the stomatal density per leaf, which vary over growth and development timescales (Dow Bergmann Berry 2014), and the aperture $a$ of the individual stomata themselves, which varies on timescales of minutes to hours (cite).  Physically-based models of $g_s$ (e.g. Buckley 2005) proceed from observations that $a$ is determined by guard cell pressure $P_g$ and epidermal cell pressure $P_e$. (Franks Cowan Farquhar 1998).  The stomatal aperture is _positively_ related to $P_g$, opening as the guard cell becomes turgid, but _negatively_ related to $P_e$ because the epidermal cells have a mechanical advantage $m$ over the guard cells:\n",

The water potential ($\\psi$) terms represent a physical hydrodynamic system that exhibits passive behavior in response to water potentials in the atmosphere or upstream from the leaf, whereas the guard cell osmotic potential ($\\pi_g$) is determined by active biochemical processes.  As Buckley (2005) analyzed in detail, the existance of the mechanical advantage of the epidermis over the guard cells _requires_ an active mechanism to overcome a \"wrong way\" response of stomatal conductance to leaf hydration or dehydration. Below, we develop a model that combines a passive physical model for $psi_g$ developed and extensively validated by Peak and Mott (2011) with an active model for $\\pi_g$ developed by Buckley (2011), which together yield a model for $g_s$."
